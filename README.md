# LC3-Brainf-k-compiler
This repository houses an LC-3 assembly language implementation of an interpreter for the Brainf**k programming language.

Brainf**k is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalistic design, consisting of a small set of commands that operate on a memory tape. The LC-3 interpreter provided here translates Brainfuck source code into equivalent LC-3 assembly code, allowing Brainfuck programs to be executed on an LC-3 architecture.

The interpreter's codebase is organized to handle Brainf**k's distinctive commands and optimize the translation process for efficient execution on the LC-3 virtual machine.
